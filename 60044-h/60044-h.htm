<div class="verse"><span class="xxlarge">Y</span>ou mutter, with your face</div>
<div class="verse">Pleading for more room because</div>
<div class="verse">It has scanned a panorama:</div>
<div class="verse">You mutter, with every difference</div>
<div class="verse">On your face an error in size</div>
<div class="verse">Mesmerized by the sight of a sky-line:</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Life is a nightmare and something delicate.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Lady, they have made a world for you,</div>
<div class="verse">And if you dare to leave it</div>
<div class="verse">They will flagellate you</div>
<div class="verse">With the bones of dead men&#8217;s thoughts,</div>
<div class="verse">And five senses, five termagants</div>
<div class="verse">Snapping at the uneasy mind.</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;No, five riotous flirts,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">You say, &#8220;and each one has</div>
<div class="verse">A thick blandishment to master the mind.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, lady, through the bold disarrangement of words</div>
<div class="verse">Life acquires with great foresight</div>
<div class="verse">An interesting nervousness.</div>
<div class="verse">But O lady with a decadent music</div>
<div class="verse">Somehow silent in lines of flesh,</div>
<div class="verse">Finding your face too small,</div>
<div class="verse">Finding the earth too small,</div>
<div class="verse">Have they not informed you</div>
<div class="verse">That crowding life into seven words</div>
<div class="verse">Is an insincere and minor epigram?</div>
<div class="verse">And have they not reprimanded you</div>
<div class="verse">Because you fail to observe</div>
<div class="verse">Their vile and fervent spontaneity,</div>
<div class="verse">These howlers of earthly shrouds?</div>
<div class="verse">And have they neglected to drive</div>
<div class="verse">The bluster of their knuckles against your face</div>
<div class="verse">Because you rush from the leg and arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></div>
<div class="verse">Anecdotes of microscopical towns,</div>
<div class="verse">Bandying with a fantasy</div>
<div class="verse">Which they call thin and valueless?</div>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Life is a nightmare and something delicate,&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">You repeat, and then, &#8220;O yes, they have done these things</div>
<div class="verse">To me because I take not seriously</div>
<div class="verse">The interval between two steps</div>
<div class="verse">Made by Death, who has grown a little tired.</div>
<div class="verse">When Death recovers his vigor</div>
<div class="verse">The intervals will become</div>
<div class="verse">Shorter and shorter until</div>
<div class="verse">No more men are alive.</div>
<div class="verse">But now they have their chance.</div>
<div class="verse">The wild, foul fight of life</div>
<div class="verse">Delights in refreshing phrases&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Swift-pouring tranquillities and ecstasies</div>
<div class="verse">Atoning for the groaning stampede</div>
<div class="verse">That desecrates the light</div>
<div class="verse">Between each dawn and twilight.</div>
<div class="verse">And those who stand apart</div>
<div class="verse">Use the edged art of their minds</div>
<div class="verse">To cut the struggling pack of bodies</div>
<div class="verse">Into naked, soiled distinctness.&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">Lady, do not let them hear you.</div>
<div class="verse">You are too delicate&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Deliberately, nimbly, remotely, strongly</div>
<div class="verse">Delicate&mdash;and you will remind them</div>
<div class="verse">Too much of Death, who is also</div>
<div class="verse">The swiftly fantastic compression</div>
<div class="verse">Of every adjective and adverb</div>
<div class="verse">Marching to nouns that live</div>
<div class="verse">Beyond the intentions of men.</div>
<div class="verse">Men are not able, lady,</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>To strike his face, and in vengeance</div>
<div class="verse">They will smear your face</div>
<div class="verse">With the loose, long hatred of their words.</div>
<div class="verse">I will wash your face</div>
<div class="verse">With new metaphors and similes,</div>
<div class="verse">Telling carefully with my hands</div>
<div class="verse">That I love you not for your skin,</div>
<div class="verse">And every bird at twilight</div>
<div class="verse">Will be enviously astonished</div>
<div class="verse">At your face now insubstantial</div>
<div class="verse">Indeed, you have an irony</div>
<div class="verse">That ironically doubts</div>
<div class="verse">Whether its power is supreme,</div>
<div class="verse">And at such times you accept</div>
<div class="verse">The adequate distraction</div>
<div class="verse">Of cold and shifting fantasy.</div>
<div class="verse">This is your mood and mine,</div>
<div class="verse">And with it we open the window</div>
<div class="verse">To look upon the night.</div>
<div class="verse">The night, with distinguished coherence,</div>
<div class="verse">Is saying yes to the soul</div>
<div class="verse">And mending its velvet integrity</div>
<div class="verse">Torn by one forlorn</div>
<div class="verse">Animal that bounds</div>
<div class="verse">From towns and villages.</div>
<div class="verse">The night is Blake in combat</div>
<div class="verse">With an extraordinary wolf</div>
<div class="verse">Whose head can take the mobile</div>
<div class="verse">Protection of a smile;</div>
<div class="verse">Whose heart contains the ferocious</div>
<div class="verse">Lies of ice and fire;</div>
<div class="verse">Whose heart with stiff and sinuous</div>
<div class="verse">Promises swindles the lips and limbs of men;</div>
<div class="verse">Whose heart persuades its confusion</div>
<div class="verse">To welcome the martyred certainties</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Of cruelty and kindness;</div>
<div class="verse">Whose brain is but a calmness</div>
<div class="verse">Where the falsehoods of earth</div>
<div class="verse">Can fashion masks of ideas.</div>
<div class="verse">Welcome the wolf.</div>
<div class="verse">Bring lyrics to fondle his hair.</div>
<div class="verse">Summon your troops of words</div>
<div class="verse">And exalt his gasping contortions.</div>
<div class="verse">Lady, it is my fear</div>
<div class="verse">That makes me give you these commands.</div>
<div class="verse">Men will force upon you</div>
<div class="verse">The garland of their spit</div>
<div class="verse">If you fail to glorify,</div>
<div class="verse">Or eagerly disrobe,</div>
<div class="verse">The overbearing motives of their flesh.</div>
<div class="verse">And every irony of yours</div>
<div class="verse">Will be despised unless</div>
<div class="verse">A hand of specious warmth</div>
<div class="verse">Directs the twist of your blades.</div>
<div class="verse">O lady, you are flashing detachment</div>
<div class="verse">Clad in exquisitely careful</div>
<div class="verse">Fantasy, and on your face</div>
<div class="verse">Pity and irony unite</div>
<div class="verse">To form the nimble light of contemplations.</div>
<div class="verse">Men will dread you as they fear</div>
<div class="verse">Death, the Ultimate Preciosity.</div>
<div class="verse">Stay with me within this chamber</div>
<div class="verse">And tell me that your heart</div>
<div class="verse">Is near to a spiral of pain</div>
<div class="verse">Curving perfectly</div>
<div class="verse">From the squirming of a world.</div>
<div class="verse">See, you have made me luminous</div>
<div class="verse">With this news, and my heart,</div>
<div class="verse">Fighting to be original,</div>
<div class="verse">Ends its struggle in yours.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Turning, we trace a crescent</div>
<div class="verse">Of conscious imagination</div>
<div class="verse">Upon the darkness of this room.</div>
<div class="verse">Night and window still remain.</div>
<div class="verse">Night, spiritual acrobat,</div>
<div class="verse">Evades with great undulations</div>
<div class="verse">The moans and exultations of men.</div>
<div class="verse">His madly elastic invitation</div>
<div class="verse">To the souls of men</div>
<div class="verse">Gathers up the imagination</div>
<div class="verse">Of one poet, starving in a room</div>
<div class="verse">Where rats and scandals ravish the light.</div>
<div class="verse">With conscious combinations of words</div>
<div class="verse">The poet bounds through space with Night.</div>
<div class="verse">Together they observe</div>
<div class="verse">The bleeding, cheated mob</div>
<div class="verse">Of bodies robbed by one quick thrill.</div>
<div class="verse">Cold, exact, and fanciful,</div>
<div class="verse">They drop the new designs of words</div>
<div class="verse">Upon a vastly obvious contortion.</div>
<div class="verse">Poet and night can see</div>
<div class="verse">No difference between</div>
<div class="verse">The peasant, groveling and marred,</div>
<div class="verse">And smoother men who cringe more secretly.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet they give these men</div>
<div class="verse">The imaginary distinctions of words.</div>
<div class="verse">Compassionate poet and night.</div>
<div class="verse">You say: &#8220;With glaring details</div>
<div class="verse">Attended by the voices of men,</div>
<div class="verse">Morning will attack the poet.</div>
<div class="verse">Men will brandish adjectives.</div>
<div class="verse">Tenuous! Stilted! Artificial!</div>
<div class="verse">Dreams of warm permanence</div>
<div class="verse">Will grasp the little weapons</div>
<div class="verse">Furnished by the servant-mind.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Dreams ... ah, lady, let us leave</div>
<div class="verse">The more precise and polished dream</div>

<div class="verse">The scoundrel, beggar, fool, and braggart</div>
<div class="verse">Fused into a loose convulsion</div>
<div class="verse">Called by men amusement.</div>
<div class="verse">Laughter is the explosive trouble</div>
<div class="verse">Of a soul that shakes the flesh.</div>
<div class="verse">Misunderstanding the signal</div>
<div class="verse">Men fly to an easy delight.</div>
<div class="verse">Causes, obscure and oppressed,</div>
<div class="verse">Cleave the flesh and become</div>
<div class="verse">Raped by earthly intentions.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus the surface rôles of men</div>
<div class="verse">Throw themselves upon the stranger,</div>
<div class="verse">Changing his cries with theirs.</div>
<div class="verse">The aftermath is a smile</div>
<div class="verse">Relishing the past occurrence.</div>
<div class="verse">Lady, since you desire</div>
<div class="verse">To clutch the meaning of this sound and pause,</div>
<div class="verse">Laugh and smile with me more sadly</div>
<div class="verse">And with that attenuated, cold</div>
<div class="verse">Courage never common to men.</div>
<div class="verse">Another window is behind us,</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">H</span>e knew that he was dead because his fingers had
forgotten the art of touching and were trying to regain
their ability. They were no longer able to separate
different textures and surfaces, and everything held to
them a preposterous smoothness that suggested an urbane,
impenetrable sophistry. With a methodical despair
they gripped one object after another, disputing
the integrity of their condition, and when at last they
capitulated he accepted the verity of his death. So
far he had not sought to use his eyes or ears&mdash;he had
existed only as a limited intensity of thought and emotion
that directed his hands in a fight for variations
in feeling. Now he discovered his sight, and in that
moment avalanches of metaphors and similes&mdash;the detailed
disguises and comparisons with which two eyes
arbitrarily brand a comforting distinctness upon a mystery&mdash;rushed
from his head and arranged themselves
to form a world. This was a reversal of life, since in
life the human eye detects and reflects the objects around
it, as all good scientists will testify, and does not first
project these objects and afterwards reflect them. But
this man, being dead, found that his eyes had thrown
myriads of determinations upon a shapeless mass and
changed it to an equal number of still and animated
forms. The desires within his eyes were continually
altering the objects around them, so that a tree became
shifting plausibilities of design and a red rose was merely
an obedient chameleon. Of course, this could never
have happened in life, since in life different shapes hold
a fixed contour, appearance, and meaning, but this man
was fortunate enough to be dead, so his eyes meddled
incorrigibly with the shapes and colors which they imagined
that they had made.</p>

he had become conscious of the result he saw that it
was a hotel-room located in Detroit, Michigan. He
examined the furniture, walls, and floor, and they were
to him the firmness of his imagination divided into forms
that sheltered the different needs within him. If he
had still been alive he would have accepted the reality
of shapes made by the majority-imaginations of other
men, regardless of whether they pleased him or not,
but death had given him a more audacious vigor and
the room in which he was sitting did not resemble to
his eyes the same chamber in which he had once reclined
during his living hours. He knew that the power
of his desire had returned him to a hotel-room in Detroit,
Michigan, and had disarranged everything except its location
and exact position. The floor was an incandescent
white and suggested a proudly prostrate expanse&mdash;it
did not have the supine appearance that pine and oak
floors hold to the eyes of life. The furniture had lost
its guise of being too economically pinned down by
curves and angles, and its lines were more relaxed and
disordered. The chairs were comfortable without relinquishing
an aesthetic sincerity of line&mdash;a semblance
scarcely ever held by chairs that figure in life&mdash;and
the top of the table was not flat but depressed and
elevated in different places, since the imagination of this
dead man had dared to become more unobstructed. The
bed had an air of counseling as well as supporting, and
its posters were high and curved in above the center
of a gently sloping bowl that formed the bottom. Also,
the walls of the room stood with a lighter erectness in
place of the rooted, martinet aspect that walls present
to living eyes, while the ceiling gave an impression of
cloth that could be easily flung aside and had not been
spread by a passion for flat concealment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>As the dead man sat in this room which he had revised,
his memory began to distribute pains throughout
his brain, and he realized that the room had dominated
the last third of his life. The room had been the scene
of his final meeting with a woman whom he loved, for
a week later she had died after being thrown from a
horse. Within this room they had spoken and touched
for the last time on earth, and afterwards the room had
become to him a square world isolated in a possibly
round world&mdash;a continent in quality and not in size,
where he could disrupt the imaginative lines fashioned
by other men, changing a rose to an intellectual face
if he so desired. Every visual detail and remembered
word of the woman had merged to a guardian silence,
enclosing this separate world with alert sentinels of
understanding. He recollected these affirmations with
the satisfaction of a transforming creator, for his experiences
had become fantasies which his memory strove
to make real. This was, however, the result of his death
for, as all good men will tell you, the memory of living
beings is entirely different and often adds inaccurate
touches to the reality of experience, making this reality
fantastic and untrue.</p>

<p>His sense of hearing revived almost simultaneously
with his memory, for hearing is the foremost aid in a
capture of past happenings since its productions do not
fade from the mind as rapidly as those of other senses.
He found that his hearing was inextricably a part of
thought and signified, indeed, the fragmentary release
of thought, and this alteration drove from him every
vestige of disbelief in his death, for he knew that in
life hearing is almost always the sense used by men
to divert the fatigue of their minds (the servant of
meaningless ecstasies). Then his sense of smell, changed
from an unseen drug to a floating search, collided with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the odor of a woman&mdash;an odor that was less smooth
and more candid than the natural ones held by women
who are alive. Turning his head to the left, for the
first time, he saw that the woman whom he loved was
seated near him. Her naked body still gave the appearance
of flesh curved as it had been during her life, but
it was no longer a slyly prisoned invitation to his sense
of touch. It aroused within him a feeling of thinly
langourous intimacy and became a visible grave into
which his thoughts could sink for future resurrection.
It was as though a desire, once coarse and reeking with
a defeated violence, had been transmuted to a longing
for less fleeting and frantic pressures, while one former
thrill became more diffused and deliberately sensitive,
finding a possession to which the sense of touch was
incidental, and not inevitable. The hemispheres of her
breasts, imperfect and firm, and the long taperings of
her limbs were to him forms which he wanted to envelope
carefully with earnest refinements of motion, gaining in
this way a less explanatory medium for his mind, and
anything resembling an invasion would have seemed to
him an abruptly senseless blunder. He saw that her
face was still a gathering of boyish bewilderments beneath
a mass of hair that had grown more cloudy, but
these expressions were hugged by a light that made them
unnecessary survivals of experience. He secured the
impression that death was amusing itself with the trivialities
of her features, while they held a perfect comprehension
of the jest without abandoning their outward
shapes. At this moment he became aware of the nakedness
of his own body and felt the loss of that snug
assurance which his skin had once given him. In its
place there was a sheath that seemed hardly more than
a visual flutter.</p>

<p>He looked up at the woman and their smiles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
adeptly synchronized. Living people are apt to smile
when they have hidden too little and weep when there
is nothing left to hide, but the smiles of this dead man
and woman were informal exercises of candour&mdash;thought
adopting more perceptible and less evasive signals.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been sitting here since your death?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;No, I&#8217;ve also been creating on the streets of
Detroit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You manage it in this way. First
you drive all of the alertness out of your senses and
your mind, and everything around you becomes a vibrating,
shapeless substance, a little thicker than mist and
hued with a gray that is almost colorless. Then you
give a moderate vigor to your senses and your mind,
and the substance breaks into hosts of shapes. You
have attained the perceptions of an ordinary, living
person and you find that you are walking on a street.
During all of this time you have held back the strength
of your imagination, which is alone real, but now you
release it and it shoots from you and follows the commands
of your desires. An old man&#8217;s whiskers change
to a weedy sprouting of thought, and each hair is the
dangling of a different idea. You can see the decay of
an empire crowding itself into a young girl&#8217;s green and
mean hat, and different events emerge and group themselves
to seize or obliterate the color. A woman&#8217;s leg
becomes a fat blasphemy and within its shaking famous
jelly you can spy a saint, writhing in the effort to free
himself. A young man&#8217;s shoulders are two, dead, delicate
thoughts caught in a bulging tomb, with their ghosts
speaking through each unconscious movement of his arms.
The street-pavement lives and is a hard, detached hatred,
sapping the strength of those who have enslaved it....
Sometimes I&#8217;ve returned to this room, not to rest, for
weariness springs only from that thick weakness of
imagination known as flesh, but to find you here before
the final emphasis of your death.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>&#8220;Since I&#8217;m not accustomed to being dead I must
ask questions whose answers are obvious to you,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Why are living beings unable to see you? How
do you avoid their jostling and the rolling devices that
they have made? How can we sit in a hotel-room, which
must at the same time be occupied by living beings, without
seeing or hearing them? Treat me as an earthly
school-boy for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Living beings dwell in realms made by their imaginations,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;We do not fit into these realms and
consequently we are not forms that can be detected by
the senses and imaginations of people who are alive.
The desires of these people have created a world of
objects and substantiations which does not match our
own, and so our world is an independent one placed over
the world of living men. With different intensities and
designs of imagination we invade a shapeless substance
and give it the elaborate distinctness of our longings.
This substance is inert imagination, and when we make
our senses and minds blank we become a part of it. Of
course, I use the word imagination because death has
not yet taught me a better one. Beyond the earth there
are stars and space which are not controlled and shaped
by our individual imaginations, and when the feet of
our imaginations become light enough to rise beyond
the shapeless mass which gave birth to them, we shall
discover what greater imaginations in turn gave birth to
the feeble beginning which formed us. And so we shall
be able to discard this word, imagination, which only
represents the boundaries of our desire and its attendant
senses and thoughts, and gain the words of greater explanations.
But before we depart from these boundaries
we must make ourselves entirely clear and untroubled,
and it will be necessary for us to reconstruct the last
meeting that we had during our lifetimes. This meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
troubles us with an unfulfillment of imagination,
and if we do not alter it the strength of our imaginations
will be hampered by a recollection of former weakness.
All men and women who die must return to the
most swiftly vivid scene that their imaginations were
able to attain during the period known as life. In this
way the scene is gradually made perfect by understanding,
and the imagination, shaking off the terror of past
weakness and indecision, is able to float away from the
substance that created it. Because our imaginations
were much stronger than the ones surrounding them, we
can achieve this task immediately, while other dead
people must slowly grapple for this emancipation, visiting
their scene in those guises which living people call
ghosts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must direct me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was never much
in harmony with the imaginative semblances and rituals
of most living people, and now that I am dead I can
scarcely remember them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Make your senses heavy and tight,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Reduce them to a condition that approaches a stupor&mdash;a
hopeful stupor such as prevails among those living
men known as mystics and priests. When you have accomplished
this, make little rows of imaginative objects
and force your mind to squeeze itself within them,
adoring some and hating others. Then try to arouse
your senses by concentrating them upon a thickly plotting
form that once was flesh, while still making them
retain a disturbing trace of their former coma. You
remember this form&mdash;separated into hairsbreadths of
worship and laceration by stunted men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your description of living imagination is perfect,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It will be minutely disagreeable to follow
your orders, but let us complete the task quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked away from each other, immersed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
strain of their inner labours. The room disappeared in
large pieces that receded to the background of a gray
substance, and consciousness left their bodies. Her body
faded out while his solidified to flesh draped by the
clumsy fears of clothes. Then the gray substance slowly
adopted the shapes, colours, and details of a railroad station.
Once more he was a suffering and encumbered
poet, standing in the battling race of people and waiting
for the train that would bring her to Detroit, Michigan.
He paced up and down the cement platform, erasing his
thoughts with the long strokes of his limbs and obsessed
only by the belief that he was walking nearer to her
in this fashion, since he was weary of being over-awed
by distance. Because he did not associate her qualities
and thoughts with those of other people he could never
convince himself that she was real unless she stood
beside him and spoke, and when her body was absent
she became the unreal confirmation of his desires&mdash;a
dream to which he had given the plausible tricks of
flesh and voice. Only the return of these two things
could reassure him, for she was to him far too delicately
exact and mentally unperturbed to exist actually in
the sweating, dense, malaria-saturated revolutions of a
world.</p>

<p>The train arrived and he stood near the gate. People
streamed out&mdash;a regiment disbanded after a lonely and
forced conflict with thought in uncomfortable seats, or
with diluted chatter that fascinated their inner emptiness.
They were the people whose vast insistence and blundering
control of the earth made him doubt the reality of
the woman whom he loved. Oh, to feel once more certain
that she was human&mdash;that her incredibly tenuous aloofness
could stoop to the shields of flesh! Yes, she would
come now, an alien straggler passively submitting to the
momentum of a regiment of people. When she failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to appear he still lingered near the gate, inventing practical
reasons for her absence&mdash;the packing of baggage,
a delayed toilette. The iron gates shut with a thud
that was to him the boot-sound of reality against his
head.</p>

<p>He bought a newspaper; sat down in the waiting-room;
and sought to submerge his distress in the hasty
and distorted versions of murders, robberies, scandals,
controversies, and machinations that defiled white sheets
of paper. But he could see nothing save a hazy host
of men fighting against or accepting the complexly sinister
fever that made them mutilate each other, and
weary of this often-repeated vision he dropped the paper.
His mind gathered itself to that tight and aching lunge
known as emotion, and morbidly he involved her in
disasters&mdash;train-wrecks, suicide, the assault of another
person. He began to feel that melodrama was the only
overwhelming sincerity in a tangle of crafty or poorly
adjusted disguises, and his emotional activity fed eagerly
upon this belief. All of the paraphernalia of fatalism
rose before his eyes&mdash;the small, lit stage with its puppets;
the myriads of strings extending into a frame of
darkness and pulled by invisible hands; the sudden
and prearranged descent of catastrophe; the laughter of
an audience of gods, examining the spectacle with a
mixture of sardonic and bored moments. But abruptly
he felt that these were merely the devices of a self-pity
that sought to raise its stature by imagining itself the
victim of a sublime conspiracy. He whistled some bars
of a popular song, deliberately snatching at an inane
relief from the industries of his mind. Then he walked
back to the gates and waited for the next train, which
was about to arrive. Once more the importantly fatigued
stream of people; once more her absence. He had turned
away from the gate when her hand questioned his
shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;And so you are real and I have not been deceived,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am as real as you care to make me,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;I was hunting for a comb in my valise when the train
came in. Combs always elude me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She mentioned the name of a hotel and they walked
to it in silence, for speech to them demanded an impregnable
privacy that was violated by even the swiftly
passing eyes and ears of other people. When they were
alone in the hotel-room he watched her remove outer
garments and don a kimono, with a pleasure that coerced
sensual longing into an enslaved contemplation&mdash;a fire
that glowed without burning.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I see your flesh then you are most unreal,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It becomes a last garment that you have
neglected to unfasten because you wish to pretend that
you belong to the earth. The cupped appeal of your
breasts is the subtle lie with which something infinitely
abstract evades the weight of a world. There is a surprised
element attached to your legs and they never
seem assured in their task of supporting your torso.
And yet, when your body is beyond my actual sight
your reality is still doubtful, for then I lack even the uncertain
evidence of your flesh. I am helpless&mdash;I cannot
mingle you with cities and men, and even country roads
seem heavily unwilling to hold you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is it impossible for you to accept this body as
a necessary, insincere contrast to my thoughts and emotions?&#8221;
she asked, with lightness. &#8220;You are tensely
morbid, Max. Now I shall sit on your knee. The scene
is prearranged. You must promptly clutch me, in that
involved manner that has made novelists famous and
blurred the integrity of poets. The earth has anointed
and pointed riots waiting for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>His fingers studied the short brown curls on her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and his lips touched the less obvious parts of her face&mdash;her
chin, the tip of her inwardly curving nose, her temples,
the meeting-place of forehead and hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see two men looking at me now,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;To one I am an emasculated fool who places a dainty
overtone upon his weakness, and to the other I am chaining
strong desires with the lies of vain and pretty gestures.
Olga, the earth is bulky and profane, and dreads
anything that delicately, aloofly disputes its size!&#8221;</p>

<p>She carefully fitted her head between his shoulder
and neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;This listening peace that you bring me, and the
softer intentions of your hands, they are more important
than the lunges of men,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are spontaneous
in ways whose breathlike intensity has not been
corrupted by the screaming of nerves, and Oh, we must
prepare ourselves for the indifference and ridicules of
a coarser audience. They cannot peer into this room,
yet afterwards something within the buoyant removal of
our bodies tells them to punish us with poverty and little
food.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grinned, and crowded flights of defiance were on
his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been eating onions and bread for the last week,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I cut the onions into various shapes, making
them resemble different articles of food. With an imaginative
seriousness one can almost overcome the sense
of taste. Almost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only that word that keeps us here,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;We are almost free illusions.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked to the bureau and brushed her hair, for
she did not want him to see an expression on her face.
He guessed it and became repentantly merry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sold a poem two weeks ago,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The editor
wrote something about &#8216;great originality but rather
tenuous&#8217; and &#8216;this is not a spiritual age.&#8217; It isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;Let me hear it,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>It concerned a circle of men dumped into chairs in
the lobby of a cheap lodging-house&mdash;rag-dolls twitching
now and then, as though an outside hand were poking
them with curiosity. Then the spirit of the lodging-house,
sallow and indecently shallow, sidled into the
lobby, correctly aimed its tobacco at a spitoon, and gave
the dolls snores to create a false appearance of life, whereupon
one of them rose and cursed the invisible intruder
in his sleep. The spirit of the lodging-house, frightened
and angry at the appearance of a soul whose existence it
had not imagined, whisked them all off to the torture
of their beds. The poem had spoken to Baudelaire and
Dostoyevsky but within it a stunned hatred of the world
was experimenting with appropriate symbols.</p>

<p>&#8220;Irrelevantly, perhaps, I&#8217;m thinking of a time when
I washed dishes in a lunch-room in St. Louis,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I was hunting in my mind for something that could
deceive the greasy monotone of defiled chinaware.
Suddenly the brown and turbid dish-water became a
heavy wine, spiced with the aftermaths of earthly pleasures&mdash;decay
to which a spiritual release had given a
liquid significance. I became obsessed by the verity of
this idea, and finally, quite entranced, I raised the pan
of dirty water to my lips and was about to drink it when,
at that moment, the proprietor came in. He squawked
&#8216;crazee-e,&#8217; &#8216;crazee-e,&#8217; and discharged me. I wrote an
excellent poem about it, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see, what would they say about this,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;Neurasthenia, insanity, exalted paranoia,
minor conceit, trivial pose, empty fantasy&mdash;they have so
many putrid labels to hide the inner rage, damn them!&#8221;</p>

<p>They swayed together in the chair, like two babies
in a trap, taking the small amount of room possible in
the cramped abode.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;Tomorrow we&#8217;ll look for work,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The
breath-tablets that you bought to hide the scent of onions
have not been able to eradicate a last melodramatic
trace of their enemy. We must move our arms to ward
off such meaningless intrusions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With an excellent verbosity you mock the concentration
of your thoughts,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>They closed their eyes and grew still in the chair.
When at last they stirred, each one looked first at the
room and then at the other person, with a gradually
slain disbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not dead after all,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;The room
does not fade away!&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat without moving, while happiness and sadness
sprang into combat within them.</p>
